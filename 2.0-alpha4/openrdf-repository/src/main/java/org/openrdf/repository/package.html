The Repository API: the main API for handling Sesame repositories.
<p>
The class {@link org.openrdf.sesame.repository.Repository} is the main access
object for Sesame repositories. It provides all sorts of operations for
manipulating RDF in various ways.
<p>
An important notion in a Sesame repository is that of <strong>context</strong>.
Within one repository, subsets of statements can be identified by their context.
<ul>
<li>The <strong>default context</strong> is the subset of the repository that is
queried when no explicit context is defined. Normally, the default context is
simply the complete repository, that is, the merge of all statements in all
contexts.
<li>A <strong>named context</strong> that has a specific context identifier (a
URI). {@link org.openrdf.sesame.repository.Repository#getContextIDs} returns all
known named contexts in a repository.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> although currently not yet supported, it will be possible
in future versions of Sesame to configure the SAIL in such a way that the
default context does not contain the merge of all statements in all context, but
only the statements for which no context has been defined. For such
repositories, the query- and retrieval methods in the Repository API will
therefore behave differently.
