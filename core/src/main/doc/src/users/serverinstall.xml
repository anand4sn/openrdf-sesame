		In this section, we explain how you can install a Sesame HTTP 
		Server. You can skip this if you are not planning to run a Sesame
		server but intend to use Sesame as a library to program against.

		<title>Required software</title>

		<para>
			The Sesame server software requires the following software:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>Java 5 or newer</listitem>
			<listitem>
				A Java Servlet Container that supports Java Servlet API 2.4 and
				Java Server Pages (JSP) 2.0, or newer. We recommend using a
				recent, stable version of
				<ulink url="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</ulink>.
				At the time of writing, this is either version 5.5.x or 6.x.

		<para>
			The Sesame 2.0 server software comes in the form of a Java Web
			Applications: <emphasis>Sesame (HTTP) server</emphasis>.
		</para>
		<para>
			Sesame Server provides HTTP access to Sesame repositories and is
			meant to be accessed by other applications. It doesn't provide
			any user oriented functionality.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you have not done so already, you will first need to
			<ulink url="http://www.openrdf.org/download.jsp">download</ulink>
			the Sesame 2.0 SDK. The Sesame Server can be
			found in the <filename>war</filename> directory of the SDK. The
			war-file in this directory needs to be deployed in a Java Servlet
			Container (see <xref linkend="section-server-required-software"/>).
			The deployment process is container-specific, please consult the
			documentation for your container on how to deploy a web application.
		</para>
		<para>
			After you have deployed the Sesame Server webapp, you should be able
			to access it, by default, at path <filename>/openrdf-sesame</filename>.
			You can point your browser at this location to verify that the
			deployment succeeded. Your browser should show the Sesame welcome
			screen as well as some options to view the server logs, among other
			things.
		</para>

	<section>
		<title>Logging Configuration</title>
		<para>
			The Sesame Server use the
			<ulink url="http://logback.qos.ch/">Logback</ulink> logging framework.
			In its default configuration, all Sesame Server log messages are sent
			to the log file <filename>[ADUNA_DATA]/OpenRDF Sesame/logs/main.log</filename>. See
			<xref linkend="chapter-datadir-config"/> for more info about data
			directories.
		</para>
		<para>
			The default log level is <parameter>INFO</parameter>, indicating
			that only important status messages, warnings and errors are logged.
			The log level and -behaviour can be adjusted by modifying the
			<filename>.../conf/logback.xml</filename> file. This file will be
			generated when the server is first run. Please consult the logback
			manual for configuration instructions.
		</para>

	<section>
		<title>Repository Configuration</title>
		<para>
			A clean installation of a Sesame Server has a single repository by
			default: the SYSTEM repository. This SYSTEM repository contains all
			configuration data for the server, including data on which other
			repositories exists and (in future releases) the access rights on
			these repositories. This SYSTEM repository <emphasis>should
					not</emphasis> be used to store data that is not related to
			the server configuration.
		</para>
		<para>
			For now, the best way to create and manage repositories in a SYSTEM
			repository is to use the Sesame Console or OpenRDF Workebench
			(experimental). The Sesame Console is a command-line application for
			interacting with Sesame, see <xref linkend="chapter-console"/>.
