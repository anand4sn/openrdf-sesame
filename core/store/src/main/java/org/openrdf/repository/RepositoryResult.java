/**
 * A RepositoryResult is a result collection of objects (for example
 * {@link org.openrdf.model.Statement}, {@link org.openrdf.model.Namespace}, or
 * {@link org.openrdf.model.Resource} objects) that can be iterated over. It
 * keeps an open connection to the backend for lazy retrieval of individual
 * results. Additionally it has some utility methods to fetch all results and
 * add them to a collection.
 * <p>
 * By default, a RepositoryResult is not necessarily a (mathematical) set: it
 * may contain duplicate objects. Duplicate filtering can be {
 * {@link #enableDuplicateFilter() switched on}, but this should not be used
 * lightly as the filtering mechanism is potentially memory-intensive.
 * <p>
 * A RepositoryResult needs to be {@link #close() closed} after use to free up
 * any resources (open connections, read locks, etc.) it has on the underlying
 * repository.
