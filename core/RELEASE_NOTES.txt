highlights the most important changes since the previous version. More detailed
information about Sesame is available from the community web site:

A WORD OF CAUTION FOR USERS OF ALPHA RELEASES
=============================================

This release of Sesame is an ALPHA release, meaning that APIs are not considered
to be stable yet and are likely to change in future releases. Alpha release are
mainly meant for the evaluation of APIs and debugging of the software. As such,
we invite you to evaluate this release and share your findings with us.

WHAT'S NEW
==========

* Sesame is now available under a BSD-style license, previous releases are still
  available under LGPL.

* The Repository and Sail APIs have been revised to use JDBC-style connections.

* The SeRQL query engine has been been replaced with an all new generic query
  engine that is modelled after the relational algebra for RDBMS's.

* Sesame now has partial support for SPARQL. Ask and describe queries are not
  yet supported, as well as a number of the SPARQL built-in functions.

* Sesame now has an HTTPSail, which allows clients to transparently communicate
  with a server over HTTP.

* The semantics of SeRQL set operations have changed: the results of the
  operands are now combined based on the variable bindings they produce. This
  means that you have to take care that the operands use the same variables
  names (or use aliases).

* The REST-style HTTP protocol has been improved. The new protocol is NOT
  backwards compatible with older versions.

* The Sesame code has been completely modularized into logical units, which
  makes it easier to reuse parts of Sesame in other projects.

* The Ant-based build system has been replaced with a Maven-based build system.

* The source code has been moved from SourceForge's CVS server to Aduna's SVN
  server: https://src.aduna-software.org/svn/org.openrdf/


KNOWN ISSUES
============

* This release contains a HUGE amount of changes to the code and, as a result,
  is expected to contain a considerable number of bugs.

* The new query engine currently lacks a query optimizer. Because of this you
  may see inferior query evaluation performance compared to earlier releases.
