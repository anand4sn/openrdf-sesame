Still to implement:
- HTTPTransaction.setNamespace() and .removeNamespace() -> protocol erweitern

Later:
- what's about the username and password?

Never:
- how to link one DTD into another (for embedding TriX DTD into DTD for transaction)? 
is this the right thing? http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/
